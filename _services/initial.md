Your mission starts with a road map. During your 60 minute initial session, we will:

* Learn about your eating habits: what, where, when, with whom, and why you eat
* Decide on an effective eating plan to meet your health goals
* Provide tailored education and counseling to help you get started

Follow-up sessions, Food Diary Feedback Service, or Membership are recommended for ongoing accountability and support.
