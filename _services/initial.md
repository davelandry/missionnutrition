Your mission starts with a road map. During this 60 minute (individual) or 90 minute (family) session, we will:

* Learn about your eating habits, environments, and routines
* Build an effective eating plan to meet your health goals
* Provide education and counseling to help you get started
* For families, discuss how to overcome issues that impact families most: picky eating, finding time to prepare food, and avoiding arguing over healthy eating habits.

You may then choose to follow your plan on your own, or, continue working with your Registered Dieitian through Follow-up Sessions, Food Diary Feedback Service, or Membership for ongoing accountability and support.
