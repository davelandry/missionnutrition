Your mission starts with a road map. During this 60 minute (individual) or 90 minute (family) session, we will:

* Learn about your eating habits, environments, and routines
* Build an effective eating plan to meet your health goals
* Provide education and counseling to help you get started
* For families, discuss how to overcome issues that impact families most: picky eating, finding time to prepare food, and avoiding arguing over healthy eating habits.
