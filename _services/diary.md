Clients have told us "If I don’t write it down, It didn’t happen." Food Diary Feedback is an online service that uses Food Diaries from a 3-7 day time period to keep you aware of your intake. After a one-time 15 minute orientation phone call, you will write down what you are eating and drinking in the format of your choosing. You will submit your diaries for analyis of:

* Nutrient Composition (including portion sizes) for alignment with your personalized eating plan
* Impacts of modifiable environments and emotional conditions

This information will be used to  create a one page summary and recommendations emailed to you within one business day. Our clients love that they can use these recommendations to adjust in the week ahead! This service works best for those who simply want advice for “what to do” and accountability to healthy eating from a supportive guide! Many people utilize Food Diary Feedback with weekly [Follow-Up Counseling and Coaching](/services/followup/) to discuss insights gained from this process to adjust goals.
