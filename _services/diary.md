Food Diary Feedback is an online service that starts with a one-time 15 minute phone call. We'll teach you how to effectively keep Food Diaries and learn your nutrition goals. Then you will keep track of what you are eating and drinking for direct online feedback from us. We'll email you a weekly summary with reccomendations to change your eating habits in the week ahead. This might be just what you need to stay on track daily.
