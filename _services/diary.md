If you're simply looking for quick, expert guidance about what to "do" to change your eating, this service is for you! Complete a one-time 15 minute phone call where we will teach you to effectively keep Food Diaries and learn your nutrition goals. Then, begin effectively keeping track of what you are eating and drinking to receive:

* 6 (recommended 1 time per week!) Food Diary Submissions via e-mail to your personal RD
* Feedback summaries returned within 48 hours of your submission to guide your eating habits in the week ahead
* Access to your RD via e-mail for brief questions clarifying how to implement your feedback, if needed
