Our most successful clients have transformed their eating spaces to ensure the only choice is the healthy choice. Home Pantry Cleanout is conducted in your home (preferred) or virtually after you’ve completed an [Initial Assessment and Goals Session](/services/initial/) with your Registered Dietitian. This 60 minute session considers the tailored eating plan you’ve developed to:

* Better understand your home food environment: strengths, opportunities, and triggers for eating behaviors
* Develop recommendations for a food environment better aligned with your health goals
* Create a tailored action plan to modify your pantry today!

After this session, your home will match your diet plan. To reinforce this experience, many people find that the [Supermarket Tour](/services/supermarket/) and [Follow-Up Coaching Counseling](/services/followup/) pair nicely with this service to maintain your new and improved home pantry space!
