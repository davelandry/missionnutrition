Does the question “What’s for Dinner?” feel like a overwhelming thing to answer? Even when you have the time to figure it all out - do you feel uncertain the food you are preparing is even working toward your health goals? Menu Planning  Education is conducted in your home (preferred) or virtually after you’ve completed an [Initial Assessment and Goals Session](/services/initial/) with us. This 60 minute session considers your personal health goals while we work together to:

* Better understand your meal preparation space and routines
* Develop planning skills: maximize your efficiency and accuracy following your diet
* Making grocery lists with the RIGHT amount of food for everyone eating in your home
* Support with menu planning: recieve templates to get you started and learn how to plan on your own.

You will leave feeling "ready to rock" in your kitchen with routines tailored to you (including a starter two weeks of menu plans and instructions with corresponding grocery lists.) Many people find that the [Pantry Cleanout](/services/pantry/) and [Supermarket Tour](/services/supermarket/) pair nicely with this service for a total transformation in their kitchens!
