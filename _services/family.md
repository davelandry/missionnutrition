If you are unsure where to start or can't get your family to see eye-to-eye about healthy eating; we can help discover new ways to reach everyone's health goals. This session is similar to our Individual Nutrition Assessment and Goal Sessions but are extended to 90 minutes to include:

* Full Family Assessment: Understanding individual needs and routines that impact change
* Meetings with at least one parent and one child (or more family members if they are available) 
* Education and Counseling on issues that impact families most: picky eating, finding time to prepare food, and balancing conflicts that may arise from changing eating in the home.

As with individuals: Follow-up sessions, Food Diary Feedback Service, or Membership are recommended for ongoing accountability and support.
