This session is similar to our Individual Nutrition Assessment and Goal Session but extends to 90 minutes to include:

* Full Family Assessment: Understanding individual needs and routines that impact change
* Meeting with at least one parent and one child (or more family members if they are available) 
* Education and Counseling on issues that impact families most: picky eating, finding time to prepare food, and balancing conflicts that may arise from changing eating in the home.

As with individuals; Follow-up sessions, Food Diary Feedback Service, or Membership are recommended for ongoing accountability and support.
