Sometimes health is important to your family, but grandparents, parents, teens, or kids aren't seeing eye-to-eye about how to get started. We can help discover new ways to reach everyone's health goals. Sessions include at least one parent and one child (or more family members if they are available). Typical topics reviewed include picky eating, finding time to prepare food, and balancing conflicting nutrition needs among family members.
