A good guide can make all the difference in your change process. Follow-Up Counseling and Coaching is conducted online or over the telephone for 30 or 60 minutes after an Initial Assessment and Goals Session. This time is dedicated to progress check-ins, goal development, overcoming barriers and "hang ups", and measuring success that is meaningful to you.
