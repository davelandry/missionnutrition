A good guide can make all the difference in your change process! Follow-Up Counseling and Coaching is conducted online or over the telephone for 30 Minutes after an [Initial Assessment and Goals Session](/services/followup/). During your session we will work with you to:

* Check in on progress with past goals
* Develop additional goals as you are ready to advance in your nutrition transformation
* Provide relevant education and tools to make things easier
* Discuss barriers and “hang ups” to change that are holding you back
* Measure, highlight, and celebrate successes that are meaningful to you

You will leave each session feeling motivated to continue on your mission! Follow-up sessions may be purchased individually or in a series.
