Follow-Up Counseling and Coaching is conducted online or over the telephone after an Initial or Family Assessment and Goals Session is completed. This time is dedicated to:

* Progress Check-Ins: Overcome "hang ups", stay accountable, and measure success
* Menu Planning: Work with your RD to develop custom, easy-to-follow "roadmaps"
* Home Pantry Cleanouts: Remove triggers for undesired eating behaviors
