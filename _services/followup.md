* Develop additional goals as you are ready to advance in your nutrition transformation
* Provide relevant education and tools to make things easier
* Discuss barriers and “hang ups” to change that are holding you back
* Measure, highlight, and celebrate successes that are meaningful to you

You will leave each session feeling motivated to continue on your mission! Follow-up sessions may be purchased individually or in a series.
