A solid plan is just the beginning. Follow-Up sessions occur after an Initial or Family Assessment and Goals Session is completed. You may select 30 or 60 minute sessions, based on your needs. This time is dedicated to:

* Progress Check-Ins: Overcome "hang ups", stay accountable to goals, and measure success
* Menu Planning: Work with your RD to develop custom, easy-to-follow menus
* Home Pantry Cleanout: Remove triggers for undesired eating behaviors
