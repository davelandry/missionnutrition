Often we work with clients who are frustrated with the overwhelming amount of products to sort through at the grocery store. Our Supermarket Tour may occur after your [Initial Assessment and Goals Session](/services/initial/). You will meet your Registered Dietitian at a grocery store you regulary attend where you will learn about:

* Saving time (and sometimes money) at the store
* Choosing foods aligned with your tailored diet plan
* Accurately reading labels and avoid misleading marketing
* Specific products and foods: review new and favorite brands including to cook, keep, and pair them with other items on your menu

You will leave the tour feeling confident in your ability to buy and maximize your purchases. Your Registered Dietitian may follow up via e-mail with recipes or more information of interest based on your experience together. Many people utilize this service with our [Pantry Cleanout](/services/pantry/) and [Follow-Up Counseling and Coaching](/services/followup/) to fully transform their routines.
