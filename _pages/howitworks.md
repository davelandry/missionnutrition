We offer a boutique-style nutrition service. Mission Nutrition emerged from a passion for helping others enjoy food to reach their best health in innovative ways. Our services are conducted outside our "day jobs", thus appointment times are limited to evening and weekend availability. If a desired appointment time is unavailable through MINDBODY, contact us to make a request for your preferred day and time - we can be flexible to accomodate your schedule! Here's how it works:
<ol>
<li> Create an account and schedule your appointment online. </li>
<li> Receive a welcome email with information about your meeting. Login at any time to manage your visit and access your personal nutrition plan.</li>
<li> Join appointments "virtually" with one-click using Zoom, our videoconferencing tool.</li> <br>

While Mission Nutrition does not currently accept insurance, we can provide a superbill documenting out-of-pocket pay for your care upon client request. Please contact us and your insurance provider for more information. We are happy to help determine if Mission Nutrition services may be submitted as an insurance claim.
