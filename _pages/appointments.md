Our services are conducted outside of our "day jobs", thus appointment times are limited to evening and weekend availability (which might align nicely with your "day job"!). Working with us is easy:

1. Create an account and schedule your appointment online.*
2. Receive a welcome email with information about your meeting. Login at any time to manage your visit and access your personal nutrition plan.
3. Join appointments "virtually" with one-click using [<img src="/images/zoom.png" height="10px">](https://www.zoom.us/join), our secure videoconferencing tool.

<small>*While Mission Nutrition does not currently accept insurance, we can provide a superbill documenting out-of-pocket pay for your care upon client request. If you intend to use this, please contact us prior to booking your appointment for more information. We are happy to help determine if Mission Nutrition services may be submitted as an insurance claim.</small>
