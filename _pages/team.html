Melissa loves helping people learn and practice healthy eating on their own terms. As a Registered, Licensed (MA#3065) Dieitian since 2010, her speciality and clinical interest areas are weight management, diabetes, and family nutrition. Melissa understands the demands of every day life and is especially skilled at listening to her clients to identify real solutions for their health concerns. This way, we can discover the path that allows you to enjoy food while eating for your best health. Melissa has co-authored nutrition research, designed effective clinical and worksite wellness programs, and lead education and training experiences for dieitians as a preceptor and volunteer for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. Melissa is currently completing a Masters of Education and continues to develop innovative strategies for online care delivery. Melissa is a Massachusetts native and currently lives in Boston with her husband, Dave, and dog, Lucy (who both benefit a great deal from her cooking adventures at home!)
