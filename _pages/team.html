  <br /><br />
Carissa’s was hooked on nutrition from her first nutrition course at the University of Oklahoma. Carissa is a people person and noticed that there are few topics that connect us together quite so well as food. After briefly living in Italy where she developed in her ability to connect with others over good food and great conversation, she got to wondering how she could support people in their enjoyment of food and best health. The leap into nutrition consulting was a natural one!

Carissa's natural ability to learn about others values and goals, plus close to a decade of training in nutrition, dietetics, and health marketing has helped those she works with stick to their values while reaching their goals. Working with Carissa 
can help solve personal and professional puzzles in ways that feel authentic and sustainable. 

Carissa graduated from the University of Oklahoma (Boomer Sooner!) with a Bachelor of Science in Nutritional Sciences and stayed to completed her dietetic internship.She continued her education by earning a Master of Arts in Health Communication from Emerson College. Carissa will be a Licensed, Registered Dietitian in January, 2016. As her day job, Carissa is a Copywriter at 
Cambridge BioMarketing.
