Melissa loves helping people learn and practice healthy eating on their own terms. 
<p>As a Registered, Licensed (MA#3065) Dietian since 2010, Melissa is specialized in weight management, diabetes, and family nutrition. As a person, she understands the demands of every day life. She guides clients toward eating solutions that fit who they are as people, too. The outcome? Enjoyment of food AND the experience of best health.</p>

Melissa has co-authored nutrition research, designed effective clinical and worksite wellness programs, and provides education experiences for dieitians. Melissa is a Massachusetts native and currently lives in Boston with her husband, Dave, and dog, Lucy (who both benefit a great deal from her cooking adventures at home!)</p>
