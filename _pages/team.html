Melissa is a Registered, Licensed (MA#3065) Dietitian specializing in weight management, diabetes, and family nutrition (including pregnancy, lactation, and child/teen nutrition). This training blends with her natural people-person abilities to create effective, memorable experiences for clients.

A firm believer that food is meant to be enjoyed, Melissa loves cooking at home with her husband Dave in Roslindale, MA. Their Jack Russell Terrier, Lucy, benefits quite often from what falls to the floor during the cooking process!

  <h3>Carissa</h3>
  <h4>Co-Founder <a class="social" href="https://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=211129797"><i class="fa fa-linkedin"></i></a></h4>

Carissa has always been drawn to supporting others, especially when it comes to their health. Originally from Oklahoma, Carissa’s love of nutrition began at the University of Oklahoma (Boomer Sooner!) Since then, Carissa has found few other topics that connect her with others as well as sharing in good food and health. After living in Italy and experiencing the impacts of positive food culture first hand, the leap into nutrition communications and consulting was a natural one!
<br /><br />
Carissa's ability to learn about others values and goals, plus close to a decade of training in nutrition, dietetics, and health marketing has helped those she works with solve personal and professional puzzles in ways that feel authentic and sustainable.

  <li><b>Fun Fact:</b> I speak (and have even taught!) Italian</li>
</ul>
