  <h3>Carissa Burton</h3>
  <h4>Co-Founder</h4>
  <img src="/images/carissa.jpg" />
  Carissa loves to talk, but more so loves to listen.
  <br /><br />
  Chatting with people and learning about their values and goals is one of her favorite past-times (seriously). This natural ability, plus close to a decade of training in nutrition, dietetics, and health communication has helped those she works with stick to their values while reaching their goals. Working with Carissa can help solve personal and professional puzzles in ways that feel authentic and sustainable.
<br /><br />
Carissa's Mission Nutrition focus is communications and consulting, as she recently graduated from Emerson College with a Masters in Health Communication. Carissa will begin seeing individual clients as a Registered Dietitian in January 2015. <a class="social" href="https://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=211129797">
