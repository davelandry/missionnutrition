Carissa has always been drawn to supporting others, especially when it comes to their health.
<br /><br />
Carissaâ€™s passion for nutrition came after taking her first course in college. Though fascinated by the science, Carissa was really drawn to nutrition as she found few other topics that connected her with others as well as food and good health. After living in Italy and experiencing the impacts of positive food culture first hand, she got to wondering how she could support people in their enjoyment of food back home. The leap into nutrition communications and consulting was a natural one!
<br /><br />
Carissa's ability to learn about others values and goals, plus close to a decade of training in nutrition, dietetics, and health marketing has helped those she works with solve personal and professional puzzles in ways that feel authentic and sustainable.
<br /><br />
Carissa graduated from the University of Oklahoma <i>(Boomer Sooner!)</i> with a Bachelor of Science in Nutritional Sciences and stayed to complete her dietetic internship training. Carissa went on to earn a Master of Arts in Health Communication from Emerson College. Carissa will be a Licensed, Registered Dietitian in January, 2016. As her day job, Carissa is a Copywriter at Cambridge BioMarketing specializing in effective health communications.
<br /><br />
Carissa is a "homebody extrovert". Since moving to Boston she has loved learning about the city and has made her way from Maine to Martha's Vineyard. Though she thrives when connecting with others and exploring new places, her home in the South End is still her favorite place to be in Boston!
<ul>
