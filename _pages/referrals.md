One of the best parts of working in healthcare is collaborating with like-minded, caring professionals like you. At Mission Nutrition, we bring excellent nutrition care to our clients in the comfort of their homes through secure online video conferencing. Read below to learn more about how we can help you help your patients: 

<strong>Who You Should Refer to Us:</strong> Any clients or patients needing support in nutrition and diet improvement; physicians, psychologists, clinical dietitians, social workers, school nurses, health coaches, and personal trainers are a few examples of referring partners.

<strong>How We Support Your Patient/Client:</strong> Many health professionals find that although they can communicate why nutrition is important, identifying optimal diets and keeping patients on track attending follow up appointments is difficult. Our service supports adherence by addressing what is important to your patient without losing sight of diet-behavior outcomes. We use evidenced based teaching and counseling strategies and timely feedback delivery to support change. This is all accomplished in the comfort of your patient's own environment using Zoom, a secure video-conferencing tool available for use on a computer, tablet, or phone.

<strong>Our Practice Areas:</strong>  Nutrition areas of focus include but are not limited to: weight loss and management with adults, teens, and children, pre-diabetes, diabetes, heart health, pregnancy nutrition, gluten-free, and other specialized diets that often require ongoing nutrition counseling. 

<strong>Preferred Care Delivery Hours</strong>: We know people are busier than ever. As a result, follow-up on referrals for in-office treatments are difficult to establish. Commute-time, parking, lost productivity from work, finding childcare, and 
reduced capacity to participate in care due to frustration all impact the success of treatments through intervention. Our clients are instead able to use this time to meal plan, grocery shop, and focus on their health and nutrition. Our approach aims to serve clients during times they are typically available, evenings and weekends. Frequency of follow-up is determined between Mission Nutrition and our clients.
